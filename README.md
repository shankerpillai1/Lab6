# Lab6
This program asks for your name and age and uses the age to determine whether you can legally drink in PA. That is pretty much it. Since the age is 21, it simply checks whether the age you entered is above or below 21 and answers accordingly.

How To Use- Installation
The program is stored in a jupyter lab notebook, so to use it the user must have jupyter lab installed, and then open this program on it following download off of github. The code is in python, so if the user only has access to a python coding environment they can also copy and paste the code into it straight from github.
Usage
The program will only request a name and age. Please enter a real number when prompted for age.
Example:
Enter your name: Shanker
Enter your age: 18
Shanker, you cannot legally drink in PA.
